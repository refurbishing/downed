# downed

## what is this?

this is a simple website that displays a countdown to the next time vercel will allow me to create a new account.

## why?

i tired switching to cloudflare pages for [my website](https://github.com/refurbishing/website) and it was pain due to sizes limits, but before that i deleted my vercel account which is a big mistake and couldn't revert back which resulted in me waiting for vercel account cooldown.. so thought making this because it's way nicer then a cloudflare 522 error code page.
